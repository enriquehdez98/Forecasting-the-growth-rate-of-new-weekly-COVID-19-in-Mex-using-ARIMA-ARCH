# Forecasting the growth rate of new weekly deaths attributed by COVID-19 in Mexico using a hybrid ARIMA-ARCH model  
 This work presents the design of an ARMA(1,4)-ARCH(1) model to be used to generate useful information for the study of epidemiology and public policies for the control of viral spread.  This model showed stability (residuals without serial correlation and homoscedastic), and also when comparing its forecasts with historical data, it presented an acceptable fit (60% of these forecasts remained within the 95% confidence intervals). These results demonstrate that the ARMA(1,4)-ARCH(1) model generated in the present work is a stable, freely available and computationally inexpensive tool for making volatility forecasts and point estimates of the weekly death rate due to COVID-19 in Mexico. It also solves the limitations of ARMA models.
